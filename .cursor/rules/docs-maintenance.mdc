# Documentation Maintenance

- After finishing implementation changes, update all relevant documentation in the same task.
- Include docs in `documents/` plus any related README or architecture notes affected by the change.
- Remove or rewrite outdated statements so docs reflect current behavior only.
- Prefer targeted edits over broad rewrites; keep docs concise and accurate.
- If no documentation updates are needed, explicitly state that in the final handoff message.

## Example

- ❌ Add mobile chat behavior but leave an old "web-only" note unchanged.
- ✅ Update the mobile chat docs and prune obsolete "web-only" statements in the same change.
